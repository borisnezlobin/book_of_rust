# hello!
I have the most amazing book! It has so many AWESOME parts!

that is to say, it's the book of ~~mormon~~ rust... see the rest of this repository for more information.

# learning rust
...on an 11-hour flight with no wifi<br />

I followed *the* book of rust (not a book of mormon reference) with local docs... it meant that I couldn't install crates or anything but that's fine tbh because I can write polyfills and like... whatever

The Minecraft launcher music in the background is really helping (I can't close it because then when I want to play later, I would need to sign in to Microsoft and I can't do that without wifi).
